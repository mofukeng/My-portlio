My Bio:
My name is Lesedi Mokone Masitha. I am originnaly from the Free State province but I grew up in Gauteng, Johannesburg. I am currently working as a personal financial advisor,
and I have a passion for technology. I have an Advanced Certificate in Information Technology and I am in the process of completing my Data Science Bootcamp with HyperionDev.
My lov for technology started very suddenly. I was never a smart guy back in high school and I use to play a lot. The COVID-19 pandemic has really shown me how criticial it is to 
have skills that are fit for the future. 

I have a passion for learning now. I believe you are never too old to pusue your dreams. I started my first qualification When I was 26 years old and I only got my first ever real job 
at the age of 26. I am motivated by a lot of things. My hunger for success is what motivates me. My family and people in my community motivate me. I want to be able to provide
for my family with ease, therefore I believe that a career in tech will give me that opportunity. 

I spend most of time either studying how technology works or in the gym, getting fit. I look forward to a very bright future and I am thankful that I have come this far with this
course and with my life.
